//    What is the perfect number?
//    A perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
//    Proper positive divisors are positive integers that fully divide the perfect number without leaving a remainder and exclude the perfect number itself.
//    For example, take the number 6:
//    Its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 3 (since 6 is the value of the perfect number, it is excluded), and the sum of its proper divisors is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
//
//    Therefore, 6 is a perfect number (as well as the first perfect number).

//    Write a method named isPerfectNumber with one parameter of type int named number.
//
//    If number is < 1, the method should return false.
//
//    The method must calculate if the number is perfect. If the number is perfect, the method should return true; otherwise, it should return false.
